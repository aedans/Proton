Proton
======

An experimental hybrid projectional text editor.

Using Proton
------------

Proton can be run easily by cloning this repository and building it with gradle.

    git clone https://github.com/aedans/proton.git
    cd proton
    bash gradlew run

Once run, the in-editor documentation can be accessed by opening the documentation folder.

Current State
-------------

Proton is currently very early in development and is unsuitable for use. There is very little documentation, and pretty 
much everything is subject to change. Feel free to poke around in the code, but don't expect things to be configurable, 
fast, or even work like they're supposed to.

Contributing
------------

Since Proton is so early in development, contributing to it is probably not a great idea. If you're interested in Proton
feel free to star it and come back to it later, but any contributions right now are likely to be outdated within a few
commits.
